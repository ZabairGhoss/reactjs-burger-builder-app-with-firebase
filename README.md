Burger-Builder-App: Real-time Burger Building and Ordering management with Firebase

# Burger-Builder-App: Real-time Burger Building and Ordering
Welcome to the Burger-Builder-App Here, I have present an in-depth overview of our dynamic React JS project that enables users to craft and place orders for customized burgers in real-time. By harnessing the capabilities of Firebase, I've incorporated a range of powerful functionalities, ensuring a personalized and efficient experience. This project boasts the following key features:

****Authentication: Enjoy a tailor-made journey with secure user authentication, providing access to a personalized burger-building experience.

****Firestore Integration: Our app seamlessly integrates Firestore, a robust database solution from Firebase, to handle data storage and retrieval efficiently.

****Smooth Hosting: Experience a seamlessly hosted platform that guarantees a smooth and responsive user experience.

Join me on this exciting venture as I delve into the intricacies of the Burger-Builder-App. Through the synergistic blend of React and Firebase technologies, I've created a platform that redefines burger customization and ordering with a real-time user experience.

# Scenario:
- the user have the exposure of adding, removing as much as they want from the ingredients.
- the user have a secured account under the usage they will manage their burger orders and other information securely.
  **** The user have majorly two usecases:
    1- User that created / already have an active account, they can login to their account and watch their order history or make a new order(s).
    2- User that have no account, but they have created burger (with desired ingredients), they need to firtly signup/create an account and then they are able to order securely.
    3- User see the order summary before putting the Order Delivery information such as Address and Mode of Delivery.
